Hello! <br/>
I am Anuj Sethia, an engineer by the mind who likes to solve complex problems and an experimental quantum physicist by heart who loves to tinker around fundamental properties of universe. Presently, I am pursuing my MSc in **Quantum Physics at University of Calgary**. I graduated from **IIT Bombay** in 2020, receiving a BTech in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Engineering Physics. I am passionate about developing quantum technologies for the next human revolution. I am particulaly interestest in quantum optics including **quantum communication and photonic quantum computing**. <br/>

Keeping aside research, I love reading, traveling and listening to music (or any combination of three, XD). Some of my favorite reading topics are: Philosophy of Science, Sociology and Politics. Coming to music, I have a great fondness to Rock music from 60s and 70s. Last but not least I am a avid mountaineer and love to go for skiing and hiking on weekends. <br/>
